"""
Longest Repeating Character Replacement
You are given a string s consisting of only uppercase english characters and an
integer k. You can choose up to k characters of the string and replace them
with any other uppercase English character.

After performing at most k replacements, return the length of the longest
substring which contains only one distinct character.

Example 1:
Input: s = "XYYX", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Either replace the 'X's with 'Y's, or replace the 'Y's with 'X's.

Example 2:
Input: s = "AAABABB", k = 1
Output: 5

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 1000
0 <= k <= s.length
