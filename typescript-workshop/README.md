## What's this course all about? 
  TypeScript is the industry’s preferred way to bring some order to the notorious unpredictability of JavaScript’s weak typing, allowing us to write more stable, production-ready web apps. In this course, we’ll get to know TypeScript through hands-on refactoring exercises, as we use increasingly complex TS features to stabilize a buggy JS app. Beyond exploring the language itself, we’ll also get familiar with popular TS tooling and workflows for full-stack development. By the end of the course, you’ll be a productive TypeScript developer ready to deepen your knowledge with further courses on FrontendMasters.
